Who are you trying to fight?
Who are you constantly trying to fight?
You from the future or you from the past?
Who are you constantly trying to find?
Can′t you see it's right here in the light?
Who are you?

Seeking answers for questions that don′t exist, don't exist
Dualities you can't stop

Bending doesn't mean breaking
It means opening your chest and breathing

A picture immaculate
Perfectly designed
A story in which you′re always desired

Proving times and times again

Bending doesn't mean breaking
It means opening your chest and breathing

Proving times and times again
