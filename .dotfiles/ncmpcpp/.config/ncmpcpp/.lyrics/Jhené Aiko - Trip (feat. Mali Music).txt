On nights like this, I ride
Turn the music up to keep from crying
Wait ′til that sunshinePlease don't let the darkness keep me low
Halfway to the home base, yeah
Like a field trip, woah
It′s a real trip

In over your head, it's a guilt trip, yeah
To the south side, wow
It's a real trip
It′s not a quick trip
It stays with ya, with ya
Love tax aside
It′s a real trip

On nights like this, I ride
Turn the music up to keep from crying
Wait 'til that sunshine
