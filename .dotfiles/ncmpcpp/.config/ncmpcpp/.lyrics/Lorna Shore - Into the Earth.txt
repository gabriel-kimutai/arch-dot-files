From the earth we will return

An inevitable fateThe undeniable truth
The paragon of life
Return to the earth
I shut my eyes and the world drops dead
I lift my head and all is born again (all is born again)

From the moment of destruction
We will create ourselves
From the moment of darkness
We will find a new light
I shut my eyes and the world drops dead
I lift my head and all is born again (all is born again)

Breathe life into the ashes
Cleanse us of our actions
The earth will quake if just for a moment
The rivers will run dry by the mire
Embers left in the wake of the lightning
And new life will be born in fire

Bursting into flames
Burning in disdain
Ash to ash
Dust to dust
Turning in the grave
Returning to reclaim
My hollow hideous soul
Fall to the earth like black snow
Envelope my withered bones

Emerging from the cinders
But Iâ€²ll be back again
When everything is withered
I'll draw my final breath
And shut my eyes as the world drops dead
Then lift my head and all is born again (all is born again)

Breathe life into the ashes
Cleanse us of our actions
Breathe life into the ashes

The earth will quake if just for a moment
The rivers will run dry by the mire
Embers left in the wake of the lightning
And new life will be born in fire

Bursting into flames
Burning in disdain
Ash to ash
Dust to dust
Turning in the grave
Returning to reclaim
My hollow hideous soul
Fall to the earth like black snow
Envelope my withered bones

Ash to ash
Dust to dust
Fall to the earth like black snow

Bursting into flames
Burning in disdain
Ash to ash
Dust to dust
Turning in the grave
Returning to reclaim
My hollow hideous soul
Fall to the earth like black snow
Envelope my withered bones

I am a hideous soul
