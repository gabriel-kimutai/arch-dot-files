Don′t be that way, fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell, but I know you too wellGot a mood that you wish you could sell

If teardrops could be bottled, there'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise, would you break it, if you′re honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you anymore

Hands getting cold, losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can′t shake, we′ve made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break

If teardrops could be bottled, there'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise, would you break it, if you′re honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I, I don′t wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
I don′t wanna be you anymore
