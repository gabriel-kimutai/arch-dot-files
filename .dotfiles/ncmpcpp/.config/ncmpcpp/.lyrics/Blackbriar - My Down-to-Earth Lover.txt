I'm a romantic at heart
Not in a rosy kind of way
But quite a darker shade
With excruciating vulnerability
And dreadful sensibility
I'd like you to levitate with me

And be a leaf in gusty winds
Guided by inexplicable things
Gusty, just like you and I

I know you are the rational type, my down-to-earth lover
Standing with both feet on the ground while I hover

I prefer singing to speech
And know that I will always sing for you
Even if I'm out of reach

I'd like to think that I lift you up
While you make sure I don't hover too far away
And get lost in another time and place

I know you are the rational type, my down-to-earth lover
Standing with both feet on the ground while I hover
I know you are the rational type, a down-to-earth frame of mind
But the thing that makes me whole is you and I combined

Oh, I will always sing for you
Just listen and you can hear me singing for you

I know you are the rational type, my down-to-earth lover
Standing with both feet on the ground while I hover
I know you are the rational type, a down-to-earth frame of mind
But the thing that makes me whole is you and I combined
